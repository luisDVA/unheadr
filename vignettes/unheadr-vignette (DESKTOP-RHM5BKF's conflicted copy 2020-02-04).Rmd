When we work with other people's data, we often have to struggle through multiple unexpected steps before we get to a flexible, usable structure.

Popular ways of structuring and presenting data can inadvertently place important content beyond the reach of code-based routines to tackle repetitive tasks efficiently and automate data processing across multiple files or very large tables. This ultimately requires a substantial amount of time and effort invested in reshaping and organizing these data manually. Repetitive click-based approaches can introduce errors, accidentally drop or duplicate information, and they often need subjective interpretations of how the data were meant to be organized.

## Package functions

The functions in this package can help us rework data shared by other people from a human-readable structure to a tidier structure on which we can more easily perform filtering, grouping, transforming, sorting, aggregating, visualization, and modeling.

For examples and uses for each function: see the function documentation and the following three blog posts:
